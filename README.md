=============
Carpooling  is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car. 
By having more people using one vehicle, carpooling reduces each person's travel costs such as fuel costs, tolls, and the stress of driving. 

Our web application essentially helps people find their car-pool mates :)
